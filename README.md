## Analytics

This extension reports some basic events and timings to help inform development decisions, such as:

- Extension is loaded
- Some settings (TODOs shown, whether you're debugging all code / your code)
- Timings (how long did extension take to load / how long till analysis server was ready)
- Crashes in the Dart analysis server

Included in the event is your platform (Win/Linux/Mac) and extension/Dart version numbers.

This can be disabled via the `dart.allowAnalytics` setting.
