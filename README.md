## Introduction

Dart Code extends [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with support for the
[Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) programming language, and provides tools for
effectively editing, refactoring, running, and reloading [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
mobile apps.


## Installation

Dart Code can be [installed from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code) or by [searching within VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_search-for-an-extension).

If you have any issues using Dart Code, please file issues on GitHub at [https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code).
