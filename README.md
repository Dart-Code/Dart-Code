### Workspace-wide symbol search (`Ctrl+T`)

### Additionally: 

- Auto-closing braces/quotes
- Document symbol list/search with highlighting
- `pub get` and `pub upgrade` commands
- Other symbol references to current symbol are highlighted
- Automatically finds Dart SDK if it is in your `PATH` environment variable

## Extension Configuration

- `dart.sdkPath`: If the Dart SDK is not automatically found on your machine from your `PATH` you can enter the path to it here.
- `dart.lineLength`: The maximum length of a line of code. This is used by the document formatter. Defaults to 80.
- `dart.setIndentation`: Forces indenting with two spaces when Dart files are opened. This is on by default because VS Code doesn't currently support per-language settings and most people use tabs/4 spaces for other languages but Convention is 2 spaces. Defaults to true.
- `dart.showTodos`: Whether to show TODOs in the Problems list. Defaults to true.
- `dart.allowAnalytics`: Note: We only send a few very basic events and the platform and extension/Dart version numbers :-)

## Analytics

This extension reports some very basic events to help inform development decisions, such as:

- When the extension is loaded
- When you enabled/disable some features (eg. showTodos)

Included in the event is your platform (Win/Linux/Mac) and extension/Dart version numbers.

This can be disabled via the `dart.allowAnalytics` setting.  

## Release Notes

### v0.8.1 *(2016-08-15)*

- The display of symbols in the workspace symbol search (`Ctrl+T`) has been improved \*
- The Dart language service will no longer crash when you enter symbols into the (`Ctrl+T`) search box
- Pressing `F5` will now allow you to run a Dart command line application (you will need to set the path in `.vscode\launch.json`) \*\*
- Organise Directives (`ctrl+alt+o`) has been added

#### v0.8.1 Known Issues

 \* Filenames may not display correctly in the stable version (1.4) of Code but will be fine in the Insiders version (and the next stable release)<br />
 \*\* Currently reading from `stdin` will cause the program to hang; this will be addressed in an upcoming release

### v0.7.0 *(2016-08-12)*

- Workspace symbol search (`Ctrl+T`) now includes more symbols from your workspace including imported packages
- Document symbol list/search has been implemented (`Ctrl+Shift+O`)
- Document highlights have been implemented (selected a symbol will highlight other instances)
- Commands for `pub get` and `pub ugprade` have been added
- Errors and warnings from files that are deleted when not open will no longer hang around in the problems view

Additionally, some non-features:

- Dart-Code now builds continiously on Travis (Mac OSX + Linux) and AppVeyor (Windows)
- Analaytics now include Dart SDK and Analysis Server version numbers to help us understand what features we can use and/or drop support for 

### v0.6.2 *(2016-08-08)*

- Find References (`Shift+F12`) has been added
- Open files are given higher priority for analysis operations
- The extension no longer tries (and fails) to analyze open files that are outside of workspace folder

Additionally, a new option `dart.allowAnalytics` was added to control if analytics are sent. Only very basic events are captured (such as extension activation and if you toggle certain features) and are sent along with the extension version/platform. No code, filenames, project names or personal information will be sent. Source code for all analytics is visible [here](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/blob/master/src/analytics.ts).

### v0.6.1 *(2016-08-07)*

- A new option `dart.showTodos` (default: `true`) has been added to show/hide TODO messages from the Problems list

- Go to Definition is now supported within your project (though does not yet work with SDK classes)
- The Dart SDK version number will now show in the bottom right status bar
- Dart files will automatically be set to 2-space indenting when you open them
- A new option `dart.setIndentation` (default: `true`) has been added to enable/disable automatic indent settings

- Tooltips reading `"undefined"` will no longer appear for some items (eg. string literals)
- Tooltip formatting/display has been greatly improved

### v0.5.2 *(2016-08-05)*
